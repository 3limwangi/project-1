    <p>
      was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
      wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was
      the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of
      Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had
      everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct
      to Heaven, we were all going direct the other wayâ€”in short, the period was
      so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities
      insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative
      degree of comparison only
